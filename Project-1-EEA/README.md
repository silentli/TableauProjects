## Data Source
[Monitoring of CO2 emissions from passenger cars â€“ Regulation (EU) 2019/631](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/co2-cars-emission-22)  
Used data from 2012-2021 of vehicles registered in Germany with BMW and MINI makes.

## Data Processing
Since the raw data was not perfect, I performed data processing using Python, including abnormal value processing, name and format alignment. Then kept only key fields.
